# OremoRemo

    May be a painless substitute for **oremo**, the sound recording tool for making personal sound bank compatible with editors such as UTAU, DeepVocel, etc.

## Notes on Runtime Env

  - targeted for **Windows**, might run on GNU/Linux 
    - since OremoRemo is free of OS dependent packages
  - reuqire Python3 environment, **Miniconda** is highly recommanded
    - if you use official Python3.7, install **PyAudio** might be painful
